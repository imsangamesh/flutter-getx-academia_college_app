## An app for our college, where basically there are 4 roles: Student, Faculty, Admin & Parent. The motto of our app is to digitally connect all these 4 roles through an app to ease different activities of the college. Here, admins can assign roles to different emails, some of the features of the app are:

- Google Authentication with bound role only
- Firebase In-app notifications to parents & students
- Attendance updation by faculty & review by students & parents
- Placement messages by admin & review by students
- Activity uploading & analysis by student & approve or disapprove by faculty
- Marks & result updation by faculty & analysis by students
- Attractive UI with theming, and more!
